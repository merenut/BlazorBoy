# Phase 11: Persistence Implementation - Comprehensive Task Breakdown

## Issue Summary

Implement comprehensive persistence functionality for the BlazorBoy Game Boy emulator, including battery-backed RAM persistence and full save state system. This phase builds on the existing `IBatteryBacked` interface and adds complete save/load functionality accessible through the Blazor frontend.

## Background & Current State

**Existing Infrastructure:**
- ✅ `IBatteryBacked` interface already implemented
- ✅ MBC1, MBC3, MBC5 classes implement battery-backed RAM
- ✅ `Emulator.GetBatteryRam()` and `Emulator.LoadBatteryRam()` methods exist
- ✅ Blazor frontend with JavaScript interop capabilities
- ✅ 789 passing tests with comprehensive coverage

**Missing Components:**
- ❌ Browser localStorage integration for automatic persistence
- ❌ Save state serialization system for full emulator state
- ❌ User interface for manual save/load operations
- ❌ Versioning system for save state compatibility

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Battery-Backed RAM Persistence (Auto-save)

- `src/GameBoy.Blazor/wwwroot/js/persistence.js` (NEW)
- Modify: `src/GameBoy.Blazor/Pages/Index.razor`
- Modify: `src/GameBoy.Core/Emulator.cs`

**Key Requirements:**
- Automatic save of battery-backed RAM to localStorage on cartridge change/unload
- Automatic load of battery-backed RAM on cartridge load
- Uses cartridge ROM hash/title as storage key to avoid conflicts
- JavaScript interop for localStorage operations

**Save State Data Structure:**
```csharp
public class SaveState
{
    public int Version { get; set; } = 1;
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }
    public string CartridgeTitle { get; set; }
    public byte[] CartridgeHash { get; set; }
    
    // CPU State

- Advanced debugging features (save state diffing)

## Dependencies

### .NET Libraries
- System.IO.Compression (already available)
- System.Text.Json (already available)
- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly (already referenced)

### JavaScript Libraries
